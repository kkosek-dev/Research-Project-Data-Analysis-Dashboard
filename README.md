## Project Description
The data source for this project comes from the Public Science Lab at North Carolina State University in an extensive research project on bacteria found in the belly button. Our webpage application uses HTML elements and JavaScript source code to enable user interaction on the webpage and allows a user to parse through each of the result files for each inidivudal surveyed. In particular, this webpage outlines the demographic info for the individual on a table and outputs a bar chart and bubble chart displaying the rate of bacteria samples as well as a gauge for the washing frequency of the individual.
